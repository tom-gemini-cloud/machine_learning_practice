    "\n",
    "Discriminant Analysis is a family of supervised classification methods that model each class's distribution and then use Bayes' rule to assign the most likely class.\n",

    "### Core idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume each data point is a feature vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ (a vector of $d$ real-valued features)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the features come from a **class-conditional density**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $p(\\mathbf{x} \\mid y = k)$ (the probability density of seeing $\\mathbf{x}$ if the class is $k$)\n",
    "\n",
    "and each class has a **prior probability**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\pi_k = P(y = k)$ (how common class $k$ is overall)\n",

    "### Prediction rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Predict the class $\\hat{y}$ by choosing the class $k$ that maximises:\n",

    "\n",
